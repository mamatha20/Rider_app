        <h2>Peak Time Charge</h2>
        <h3>Before knowing about OLA’s peak time charge, it is important for you to know how OLA works.</h3>
        <h3>OLA’s business model</h3>
        <p>OLA is an online marketplace for drivers.</p>
        <p>These drivers are independent and they are either self-employed (own their commercial vehicles), or work for an Operator who owns multiple cars.</p>
        </p>Like you have an OLA app on your smart phone to book a cab, these drivers have a similar Driver mobile App on their smart phones. We activate the Driver app after a thorough check of authenticity and conducting due diligence of the commercial & personal papers of the driver & operator. These drivers decide their own time to login to the OLA application and accept requests for rides from customers. They may choose to remain logged out of the system as per their convenience.</p>
        <h3>Q: What is OLA’s peak time charge?</h3>
        <p>OLA peak time charge is a fare-rationalizing rule of using a multiplier X or a flat surcharge to the standard fares causing the fare to be higher than the standard fare during certain times the day; i.e. if X is 1.2 during some point of time then the standard fare will be multiplied by 1.2 to get the final fare.</p>
        <h3>Q: Why is there a need to apply a surcharge to my standard fare?</h3>
        <p>OLA being a marketplace doesn’t control the number of vehicles online on its system/platform; drivers & operators are independent & work as per their convenience. During a normal day when demand & supply are met, there is no need to put an extra effort to pull the supply side of vehicles.</p>
        <p>OLA has observed that during certain times of the day, when more traffic is on road, routine drivers tend to log out of the system to suit their convenience as there is no incentive for them to put an extra effort. Similarly, when demand suddenly increases, not enough drivers might be available on the road. Customers might be inconvenienced by not being able to find cabs during such times.</p>
        <p>As a system/solutions provider OLA has limited options to motivate the drivers and cater to the high demand timings & scenarios. OLA has observed that the drivers are very sensitive to little extra earnings for their extra effort to stay logged in to our system.</p>
        <p>OLA applies an X multiplier or flat surcharge to the normal fare based on various situations and scenarios like place of pickup, time of pickup, type of vehicle, demand situation, supply scenario etc. Using advanced analytics, unique algorithm, past ride experiences etc. the OLA software calculates an appropriate surcharge to apply over and above the normal fare. This enables OLA to come up with appropriate incentives to drivers to make them stay logged in to the system for the additional earnings. This enables customers to get their much needed service even during peak times when demand for cabs is high.</p>
        <p>The peak time surcharge works in two ways</p>
